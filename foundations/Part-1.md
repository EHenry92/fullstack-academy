## Intro to VCS and Git

- [x] Complete the course [*Git Basics*][4] on Treehouse.
- [x] Complete the course [*tryGit*][5] on Code School.
- [x] Refer to this [*Guide for Setting Up Git*][6] on GitHub.
- [x] Answer Recap Questions.
	- **What is a Version Control System?**
		- A repository of files, often files for source code of computer programs, with monitored access.
	- **How do you create a remote repository?**
		- `cd my_project`
		- `git init`
		- `git add *`
		- `git commit -m "initial commit message"`
		- `git remote add origin git@example.com:my_project.git`
		- `git push -u origin master`
	- **What is the process of cloning and forking a repository? What is the difference?**
		- Cloning is built into Git while forking was actually just an operation made popular by GitHub.
		- Cloning is just copying one repo into another, while forking is more like using someone's else repo as a starting point so you can make your own changes.
		- The two processes actually quite similar.
		- Forking is done using GitHub, while cloning is built into Git and can be used to fork repos as well.
	- **What is the staging area and how do you add files to it?**
		- The staging area is a file (usually located in your Git directory) that stores info about what files will go into your net commit.
		- So let's say I change this `README.md` file like I'm doing now. Once I "stage" the files, I'm telling Git that I intend to commit these changes but as to when, I'm not telling yet. However, once I've committed, my `README.md` file is no longer in the staging area. 
		- Ergo, the staging area is like when the files are in beta, and are not yet publically released/committed to the GitHub repos.
